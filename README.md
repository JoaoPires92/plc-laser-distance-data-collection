# plc-laser-distance-data-collection

A windows form desktop application developed in vb.net to interface with two different PLCs (Siemens & Allen Bradley) to grab stored data from a laser distance sensor. This sensor is mapping out a bed surface on a production machine to ensure that the work product is levelled up and wihtin 100um of Runout.   
This data is then analysed as part of a preventive maintenance activity or for a debug purpose. 
This application is able to grab all data at once in just a few seconds. This data is then stored in arrays and presented to the user with final PASS/FAIL Results. It can also be downloaded for external review.
